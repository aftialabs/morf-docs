## Data Policy

Aftia does not retain form data submitted or processed through the Morf Render, Submission and Conversion Services.  Form data is securely passed on to other services for processing and storage. 

Data about Customers, and the Customer's users is retained and stored for the purpose of administering and managing customer forms, reports, and other application assets.  Customers can request that their users data be permanently deleted should they stop using the Software, or if the deletion does not impact the regular operation of their use of the Software. Aftia stores Customer and user data in Microsoft Azure Cosmo DB in the NA region. Backups are taken on a regular basis. All data is encrypted using industry-standard methods when stored on disk or transmitted over the network. Only authorised staff may have access to Customer or their user's data.


## Privacy
By agreeing to these terms and conditions, the Customer agrees to permit Aftia to track platform and form usage in order to provide reporting capabilities and enhance the platform.  Examples of this are:
- renders
- submissions
- bounce rate
- form fill time and form user activity
